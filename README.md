# test_vuejs

Working out some vue.js examples to write about on my website here at [github pages](https://dustinpfister.github.io/). Many of these examples are on various asspects of the framework by itself, others are full working simple project examples.

## setup

Clone it down and do a npm install to install the packages that I use for the back end scripts

```
$ git clone --depth 1 https://github.com/dustinpfister/test_vuejs
$ npm install
```

## run the simple static server script

To start the simple static server

```
$ npm run static 3000
```

Then I just need to go to http://localhost:3000/ in my browser to use any and all vuejs examples

## run list script

To start the list script on a given port such as 3000 I run the npm script for it.

```
$ npm run list 3000
```
