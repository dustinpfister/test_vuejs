# test_vuejs

Working out some vue.js examples to write about on my website here at github pages.

## setup

Clone it down and do a npm install

```
$ git clone --depth 1 https://github.com/dustinpfister/test_vuejs
$ npm install
```

## run list script

To start the list script on a given port such as 3000 I run the npm script for it.

```
$ npm run list 3000
```

Then I just need to go to http://localhost:3000/ in my browser to use any and all vuejs examples
