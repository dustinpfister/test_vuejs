# vuejs-filter todo list

Some examples for filters in vuejs for my [post on the topic of vue filters](https://dustinpfister.github.io/2019/05/10/vuejs-filter/). Filters are use for the most part just to format text values when working out a static template for a Vuejs instance. They are simular to methods but they are a little less flexabule and are just used for text nodes and values for attributes using the v-bind directive.
