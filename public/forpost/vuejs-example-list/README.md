# vuejs-example-list

This is my take on a simple todo list app using vuejs as a front end framework to which I have wrote about in detail on my [blog post on this todo list example](https://dustinpfister.github.io/2020/02/18/vuejs-example-list/). So yes this is yet another one of those kinds of applactions, but it still serves its purpose of just learning how to create some kind of applaction with a framework at least.

The example makes use of static templates, global mixins and components, events, static templates, and the v-if directive to just name a few vuejs features. I am also making use of local storage as a way to save the state of the list.
